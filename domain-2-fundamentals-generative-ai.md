### 2.2: Understand the capabilities and limitations of generative AI for solving business problems
Objectives:
- Describe the advantages of generative AI (for example, adaptability,
responsiveness, simplicity).
- Identify disadvantages of generative AI solutions (for example,
hallucinations, interpretability, inaccuracy, nondeterminism).
- Understand various factors to select appropriate generative AI models (for
example, model types, performance requirements, capabilities, constraints,
compliance).

example, cross-domain performance, efficiency, conversion rate, average
revenue per user, accuracy, customer lifetime value).

#### Describe the advantages of generative AI

- [kodekloud - Capabilities and Limitations of Generative AI Applications](https://notes.kodekloud.com/docs/AWS-Certified-AI-Practitioner/Fundamentals-of-Generative-AI/Capabilities-and-Limitations-of-Generative-AI-Applications)

- Adaptability
- Responsiveness
- Simplicity
- Creativity and exploration
- Data efficiency
- Personalization
- Scalability

#### Identify disadvantages of generative AI solutions

- Regulatory violations
- Social risks
- Data security and privacy concerns
- Toxicity
- Hallucinations
- Interpretability: Simpler models like decision trees offer higher interpretability, while complex models like deep neural networks are often considered "black boxes" due to their intricate architectures.
- Nondeterminism
- Plagiarism and cheating

#### Understand various factors to select appropriate generative AI models
- [Best Practices for Generative AI Applications on AWS: Model Selection and Implementation Strategies](https://aws.amazon.com/es/awstv/watch/2e92fd37882/)
- [Amazon SageMaker Model Cards](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-cards.html)

#### Determine business value and metrics for generative AI applications
- Cross-domain performance
- Efficiency: Measures how cost-effectively and quickly the AI model can be deployed, focusing on resource utilization and time to market.
- Conversion rate: The conversion rate is a key business metric that directly measures how well the AI solution drives desired user actions, such as making a purchase or signing up for a service.
- Average
- Average Revenue per user(ARPU): Average revenue per user, or unit, is a metric used by app businesses to calculate how much money they generate from a user during a specific, set time period.
- Accuracy
- Customer lifetime value
- Transfer learning: Technique where a pre-trained model is adapted to a new task or domain by fine-tuning it with a smaller dataset specific to the new task.
